# Enhanced Forecasting Model: BERT and Text-davinci-003 Integration
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a finely-tuned machine-learning model for accurate predictions by integrating techniques like OpenAI's text-davinci-003 and BERT embeddings. This model aims to forecast responses to questions from diverse forecasting tournaments, encompassing true/false, multiple-choice, and numerical formats with precise resolution criteria.

## Dependencies
